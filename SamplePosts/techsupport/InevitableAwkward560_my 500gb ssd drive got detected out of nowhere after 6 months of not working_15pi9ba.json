With harddrives yes, but faulty hdds can appear and disseappear with each boot, not in the scope of 6 months. My bet is that the interface is broken. A cracked solder or something of that nature. If it's in the laptop chances are you can still use that ssd in a different computer/ sell it (make sure to do a proper format). But for that you need to test it in a different computer, to confim that hypothesis. Anyways, I wouldn't trust the ssd as it is. Back up what you have on there and then take it out. It can't be trusted anymore, at least in this laptop (assuming it's a interface problem).",
