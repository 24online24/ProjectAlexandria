This subreddit took part in several protests over [how the platform is run and how recent changes would impact the experience of users and the ability for community leaders to moderate subreddits](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/28/reddit-protest-user-engagements-site-activity-impact/). These protests have been unsuccessful in changing the direction of Reddit administration.\n\nReddit admins have lied about their plans, [made serious accusations against app developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), and [said derogatory things about the moderators who make Reddit's business model possible](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/reddit-ceo-steve-huffman-landed-gentry-18237821.php). Every other major social media service has paid moderators to approve or remove content. This job is often [outsourced to countries in the global south](https://mashable.com/article/chat-gpt-open-ai-workers-exploitation) and has been known to cause [trauma from the horrible things posted to social media](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57088382). Reddit outsources this to community moderators who do it for free. For /r/TechSupport, moderators need to be experienced technicians.\n\nReddit leadership has made it clear that the opinions and concerns of the people who make the site function do not matter. With less tools to keep the space running smoothly and a hostile site administration, things will only get worse until everyone goes somewhere else and Reddit becomes [irrelevant like many places have in the past](https://searchengineland.com/digg-v4-how-to-successfully-kill-a-community-50450). \n\n***It is time to move on from Reddit to less terrible places***, including to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/2EDwzWa). If Reddit wants to be hostile to the community, the community owes it to Reddit and themselves to move elsewhere. **We aren't closing the sub**, but the quality of help and moderation will only decrease as mods and helpers spend more of their time on other parts of the web. \n\nWe'll provide more updates when they're available. Thanks for your time and contributions.\n\nEdit with a tl;dr - business as usual, but we can't do what we need to do as well anymore.", "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "permalink": "/r/techsupport/comments/1583ad4/another_update_on_our_future/", "id": "1583ad4", "author": "BigCatSanctuary", "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 104, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": "moderator", "created_utc": 1690183247.0, "comments": [{"author": "macieksoft", "id": "jt8i3eg", "score": 78, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "1583ad4", "stickied": false, "body": "Discord is definitely not a proper alternative.

You lumped them in the \"unpaid man hours\" that you mentioned the mods in the same breath.  \n\nNow, the amount they're paying is not out of line.  The original post from the Apollo dev pointed out that it would have required him to collect $2 more per user per month than what he is already getting.  Now as to the \"industry rate\" - that's kind of misleading.  Most websites have API access that is incredibly costly, and you negotiate with them to lower the cost or the API encourages you to incorporate their features.  For example, AWS offering API access to them is a benefit to the consumer and makes them want to use AWS, so their API price reflects that.  It increases consumption of AWS resources so they make their money on the backend instead of up front through the API.  Companies like Facebook/Instagram don't charge for their API, but also are selective on granting access.  They don't just let anyone create an API account.\n\nNow if we look to other sites that are crafted entirely on user based content, like Fandom, they don't charge for their API but HEAVILY restrict usage.  500 requests a day max, with their premium account holders getting 5000.  Similarly, eBay also has hefty rate limits on API usage to their platform.  Twitter, a similar site in rate of page views has a similar cost as, like reddit, it spends a lot of money hosting API calls.\n\nSo the false narrative that you were fed of \"no one else does this\" is misleading at best, but honestly pretty false.  Sure, most companies don't charge that much, because they wouldn't let you do that much.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1690216588.0, "parent_id": "t1_jt9ftrg", "replies": [{"author": "XmentalX", "id": "jt9oiac", "score": 1, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "1583ad4", "stickied": false, "body": "I never said app developers weren't making money all I said was they were expected to roll over.

It would have required you to pay for the app on a monthly cost.  Now, if the app isn't well optimized for making calls, it's going to be more expensive than a better optimized app.  Either way, it's going to have a cost to it.  Again, the largest app said that he would have needed to collect only $2 more per user than he was already getting and that was strictly off the donations he was getting.  Spread that out across the entire userbase and it would be incredibly easy to spread that cost out.\n\n>This also doesn't address why they locked out nsfw content.\n\nI'd imagine this is around the growing complexity of adult content.  For example, does reddit need your ID if you are in Virginia?  Well, if they disable that they have no need to have that discussion.  It also stops them from becoming Tumblr which became a huge porn site over lower content.  Or Onlyfans which was supposed to be a Patreon style site that ended up just being for porn.\n\nNSFW content has always been a thorn in reddits side, but they want the site visits so restricting it from API calls helps with that, especially since nsfw content makes them zero dollars at all.\n\n>This was meant to push people to their shit app and let's face it this app is shit.\n\nOK.

Remember when California wanted to pass their own \"net neutrality\" laws to force ISP's to capitulate to their version of net neutrality?  It wouldn't have mattered if I as a non-California resident didn't want a company to do it, they would have had to comply with those network requirements.  Similarly, laws like the Virginia ones (along with other countries like Australia and the UK censorship laws) are impacting users globally.  Sometimes you can skirt around those laws, but I can guarantee the people that got the Virginia law in place are going to find a case to make that someone accessed NSFW content without providing ID and it's going to force reddit to comply with such draconian measures.  In advance of that, they've just implemented a work around.\n\nAlso, the liability of checking ID or complying with these kinds of laws is on the website, not the user.\n\nThis also ignores that allowing NSFW content through API is going to cause a whole host of issues with people creating porn apps using reddit as a host.  Porn is an area that people easily pay for content and access.  If reddit allows API access to someone that monetizes user content, especially porn, that could be a huge problem for them.  Because right now reddit doesn't monetize NSFW content.  But since they're selling API access, well now they're monetizing that content and monetizing user provided porn goes into a wild area.  Not to mention all other nsfw content.  Can you imagine someone sharing a video of a crash where someone dies or suffers injury and reddit is making money on that tragedy?\n\nYou can be against it all you want, but that doesn't mean there are real legal potholes that they have to navigate.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1690222345.0, "parent_id": "t1_jt9zgov", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "Bobmanbob1", "id": "jt868xs", "score": -33, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "1583ad4", "stickied": false, "body": "Reddit so needs to fire your asses.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1690188525.0, "parent_id": "t3_1583ad4", "replies": [{"author": "XmentalX", "id": "jt9cl1v", "score": 5, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "1583ad4", "stickied": false, "body": "how can you fire who was never hired to begin with?
