I stripped it down as fast as possible and came to the conclusion that a psu capacitor was blown and leaking fluid all over the psu. I'm worried that it might have taken some other components of the pc along with it when It died. \n\nWhat are the black 420v caps used for and what are the chances that the rest of my pc is unaffected?", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/techsupport/comments/15pqp4n/power_supply_capacitor_blown/", "id": "15pqp4n", "author": "Committee_Gloomy", "link_flair_text": "Open | Hardware", "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1691905567.0, "comments": [{"author": "scalyblue", "id": "jvz3svt", "score": 3, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "15pqp4n", "stickied": false, "body": "Generally speaking when a psu fails it tries really hard to fail in a manner that doesn\u2019t overvolt the connected components.\n\nNo way to really find out short of probing all your voltage lines with a meter to see if they have shorts to ground, which is way more time consuming than popping in another psu", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1691910501.0, "parent_id": "t3_15pqp4n", "replies": []}, {"author": "ElectronicInitial", "id": "jvz0cpq", "score": 2, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "15pqp4n", "stickied": false, "body": "There really isn\u2019t much that we can say about the other components being affected.
