You dont work 100% of time on this temperature, if it doesnt reach 100C its not dangerous.\n2. It potentialy can lower lifespan of cpu, which is very high anyway, never seen dead CPU without dead motherboard and would say CPU often survive when motherboard die for some reason\n3. You can lose performance cause motherboard or cpu itself(not sure which one control that) will do everything it can to maintain safe temperature and don't cut off power to protect PC from damage.\n\nIn order to lower this temperature you can try changing thermal paste, change CPU cooler and if you saved money on PC case and bought something designed for office purposes you might want to buy something with actual air circulation.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1691907094.0, "parent_id": "t3_15potkv", "replies": [{"author": "Tompork", "id": "jvyzauf", "score": 1, "subreddit": "techsupport", "author_flair": null, "submission": "15potkv", "stickied": false, "body": "ah and 1 more thing.
